# HonestyStoreManager

Learning project: Java console app implementing user management, product tracking, and flexible billing for an honesty-based store.

## Features
- Admin can create users and manage products.
- Customers can log in, record purchases, and view their purchases.
- Billing is flexible: users can request a receipt anytime or wait for the end-of-month summary.
- Data persistence: stores users, products, and transactions in files.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open in IntelliJ IDEA (or any Java IDE).
3. Run `Main.java` from the `com.honestystore` package.
4. Follow the console menus to login, manage products, or record purchases.

## Future Improvements
- GUI interface using JavaFX.
- Database support (SQLite or H2) for more robust persistence.
- User authentication and password hashing.
